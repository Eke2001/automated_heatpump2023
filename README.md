## Automated heatpump
Works via fetching prices online using cURL, processing the data
and then controlling the heat pump accordingly via a
local server, where the heat pump (controls) are hosted on.


Written by 2 students (1 of them being me) for a software project in uni. Has been tested and works. Circa 20-60% cheaper to heat a home using this than doing it manually / with fixed time periods. Atm doesn't take into account month changes iirc.
